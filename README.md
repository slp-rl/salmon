# :sushi:SALMon: Suite for Acoustic Language Model evaluation :sushi:
This repostory contatins the offical code both for evaluting your model using SALMon, and for reproducing SALMon - as described in the paper "[A Suite for Acoustic Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07437)".

## Run SALMon
### Installation
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/slp-rl/salmon.git
```
Our benchmark is published in google drive - ([unzipped](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pVv6iMmP_VXH6Goxwnmpy-5h3jPAoJ0t?usp=share_link), [zipped](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qXvKtrGDVSALWDVjLi7gDBd9SkDXy10/view?usp=share_link)). We also publish the dataset in ü§ó[HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/slprl/SALMon) - yet the integration with this code is not yet fully supported.

```bash
cd salmon
# This might require installing gdown, see - https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
# You may also choose to manually download the files from the link above if you prefer
gdown 11qXvKtrGDVSALWDVjLi7gDBd9SkDXy10
unzip -q salmon_benchmark.zip
rm salmon_benchmark.zip  # cleanup
```

### Requirements
The only dependencies you need for running the benchmark are `torch` and `torchaudio`, specific baselines may require additional installation (such as textlesslib). The code was developed and tested with `python==3.10`, but should work with other, recent versions. 

### Evaluate Your Own Model
All you need to do in order to run SALMon on your SLM is to inherit from `InferenceModel` and implement the abstract methods.
```python
class InferenceModel(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def log_likelihood(self, wavs: List[torch.Tensor]) -> torch.Tensor:
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def to(self, device):
        ...
```

When your model is ready, don't forget to add it also in `InferenceModelFactory` inside `baselines/inference.py` and a config file in `baselines/configs/inference`. There are many examples provided.

### Run!
After implementing both abstract methods and downloading the data, you can just run `salmon.py` and check your model's acoustic perception!

```bash
python salmon.py -c MODEL_CONFIG_PATH -s SALMON_FOLDER_PATH -p all
```

We provide an example for running a random model (without further requirements) or TWIST (with additional requirements) as reported in the paper:
```bash
python salmon.py baselines/configs/inference/random.json -s salmon_benchmark -p all  # Random dummy model
python salmon.py baselines/configs/inference/TWIST-350M.json -s salmon_benchmark -p all  # TWIST 350M

```

## Leaderbord
We provide here a short version of the leaderboard for a live sortable version see the [project page](https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/salmon/) or Papers with code (soon!).
